# DashboardWeather

## Description

A weather application that allows a user to search the weather outlook for multiple cities. Allows the user to better plan for events and travel.

## Features

Upon searching a city, user is presented with current and future conditions for that city, + the city is saved in the search history. Current weather conditions reflect the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index. UV index is color coded to indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Future weather conditions present a 5-day forecast that displays the date, weather conditions, temperature, and humidity. Cities saved in search history render both current and future conditions when clicked.

User experience is intuitive and easy to navigate; user interface style is clean and polished.
